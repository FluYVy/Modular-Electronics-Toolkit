# Modular-Electronics-Toolkit

This project is a diploma thesis done at the [HTL Rankweil](https://github.com/htl-rankweil). It aims to provide future students with a better way to understand and work with different sensors and actuators. The system created aims to be modular so that different parts of it can be mixed to create new and creative projects. Different libraries are also provided to help students use these modules.

To further help with the development of different projects, a visual coding engine can be used to create the needed code. This is done with [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly), which was developed by Google.

## Key Features
### Compability
The modules created should be compatible with any microcontroller, as long as they can handle 5 volts.

> [!WARNING]
> The provided code and libraries have only been tested with a board using the ATMEGA16A-Chip. For other microcontrollers, you may need to create your own code.

### Modular
The modules are designed to be able to create new projects by combining them together. As such, even complex problems can be solved easily.

### Easy to use
The libraries are designed to be used by students and as such are easy to use and adapt to your project or solution. This is reinforced by the block-based code editor for easy project creation. 


## Used Software and Libraries
* [Microchip Studio](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio) for programming the libraries
* [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) for creating the modules
* [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) as a library for the blocks-based code editor

## General

Each PCB should follow the Gridfinity specifications. This ensures compatibility with the Gridfinity modular system, allowing modules to be freely arranged and stacked without additional components. The PCBs attach to the Gridfinity containers using four M3 screws located at the corners of the PCB.
The specifications of the Gridfinity system can be found [here](https://gridfinity.xyz/specification/).
